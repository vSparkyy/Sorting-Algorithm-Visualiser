# Sorting Algorithm Visualiser
A Sorting Algorithm Visualiser to demonstrate the algorithms of Quicksort, Bitonic sort, Heap sort, Merge sort, Pigeonhole sort, Comb sort, Bubble sort and of course, Bogo sort.

## Features

- Interactive graphical representation of sorting algorithms.
- Multiple sorting algorithms included: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Bitonic Sort, Comb Sort, Pigeonhole Sort, Bubble Sort, and Bogo Sort.
- Adjustable array size and sorting delay.
- Keyboard shortcuts for starting sorting, changing algorithms, and shuffling bars.
- Informative GUI elements displaying selected algorithm, elapsed time, and more.
